# Heython

A Hebrew interpreter in Python, it lets you use Hebrew to program in the best programming language.

You can use the source itself or the exe file, either way you could just run it to start using the interpreter, but you could also use the command line to execute commands directly (withuot opening the interpreter) and to run files (the code detects if you gave it a file or a command) or you could simply drag files to the exe to run them.

You may need to do some work to make your CMD compatible with Hebrew, but you could just run it in [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

You can see the entire translation in the [translation file](https://github.com/donno2048/Heython/blob/main/Dictionary.md).
